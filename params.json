  "body": "# SuperMiner - Making mining easier...\r\n\r\nSuperMiner is a collection of sub-mods that have been designed to make life easier...\r\n\r\n_Inspiration has been taken from several different mods already avaliable; namely - VeinMiner, TreeCapitator, AutoSwitch & NEI's Magent Mode. My thanks and admiration go out to their respective developers._\r\n\r\n...with a few additions of my own design.\r\n\r\n***\r\n## SuperMiner sub-mod list:\r\n* **Captivator:**  Automatically pickup items and XP orbs. _[Magnet mode]_\r\n* **Cropinator:**  Makes Farming easier and the Hoe more useful.\r\n* **Excavator:**  Digs a big hole by breaking connected blocks, of the same type, within the specified range.\r\n* **Illuminator:**  Automatically lights up the area while you mine.\r\n* **Lumbinator:**  Chop down an entire tree.\r\n* **Shaftanator:**  Dig yourself a mine shaft.\r\n* **Substitutor:**  Automatically select the correct tool while you mine.\r\n* **Veinator:**  Mine an entire vein of ore.\r\n\r\n***\r\n### Full SuperMiner Details Here:\r\n\r\n* [**mods.io**](https://mods.io/mods/1217)\r\n* [**MinecraftForum.net**](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2372329-superminer-making-mining-easier)\r\n\r\n***\r\n**Be So Kind and Support Me, help me pay for Stuffs and Ensure I can continue to Update my Mods...**\r\n\r\n[![](http://i.imgur.com/CAJuExT.png) **Support me via Patreon**](https://www.patreon.com/DuelMonster)\r\nor\r\n[![](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_GB/i/btn/btn_donate_SM.gif) **via Paypal**](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=9VMJMWCLDM4DE)\r\n\r\n***\r\n## Reviews/Spotlights:\r\nHuge thanks to **[MininMartin](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYp90PP1avzZtsyfMlMquVA)** for the first ever video. Spanish Speaking:\r\n[![Spotlight](https://j.gifs.com/pY1og1.gif)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyVO_wlpZ9Q)\r\n\r\n***\r\n## FAQ:\r\n**What's the reasoning behind these mods I hear you ask...?**\r\n> Well as much as I love VeinMiner, TreeCapitator, AutoSwitch & NEI's Magent Mode, I have always had the odd niggle with them here and there. So I set out to improve a few areas and dumb down others, as well as produce a few ideas of my own.\r\n\r\n**How do I compile the Source?**\r\n\r\n[**Compiling SuperMiner**](/SETUP.md)\r\n\r\n***\r\n## Mod Pack Policy:\r\n\r\n> Any Mod pack requests will probably be ignored for the most part, but please note that I give my full permission to include the SuperMiner mods in any mod pack, as long as the following conditions are met:\r\n\r\n*   Ensure you provide a link to this forum post.\r\n*   Properly credit me as the author of these mods - DuelMonster\r\n*   You mustn't make any money off of your mod pack.\r\n*   Be sure to remove these mods from your pack if I specifically request it.\r\n\r\n***",
