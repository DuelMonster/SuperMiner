# SuperMiner - Making mining easier... ![](https://travis-ci.org/DuelMonster/SuperMiner.svg?branch=1.9.4)

SuperMiner is a collection of sub-mods that have been designed to make life easier...

_Inspiration has been taken from several different mods already avaliable; namely - VeinMiner, TreeCapitator, AutoSwitch & NEI's Magent Mode. My thanks and admiration go out to their respective developers._

...with a few additions of my own design.

***
## SuperMiner sub-mod list:
* **Captivator:**  Automatically pickup items and XP orbs. _[Magnet mode]_
* **Cropinator:**  Makes Farming easier and the Hoe more useful.
* **Excavator:**  Digs a big hole by breaking connected blocks, of the same type, within the specified range.
* **Illuminator:**  Automatically lights up the area while you mine.
* **Lumbinator:**  Chop down an entire tree.
* **Shaftanator:**  Dig yourself a mine shaft.
* **Substitutor:**  Automatically select the correct tool while you mine.
* **Veinator:**  Mine an entire vein of ore.

## FAQ:
**What's the reasoning behind these mods I hear you ask...?**
```
Well as much as I love VeinMiner, TreeCapitator, AutoSwitch & NEI's Magent Mode, I have always had the odd niggle with them here and there. So I set out to improve a few areas and dumb down others, as well as produce a few ideas of my own.

**How do I compile the Source?**
